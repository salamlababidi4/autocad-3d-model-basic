# autocad-3d-model-basic
This project contains a simple and small 3D model created using AutoCAD. It highlights the fundamentals of 3D modeling and serves as a stepping stone toward more advanced design work. The model demonstrates essential skills in geometry creation, manipulation, and visualization within AutoCAD.  

### **Purpose**  
The purpose of this project is to practice and showcase basic 3D modeling techniques using AutoCAD. It is ideal for beginners exploring 3D design and serves as a foundation for building more complex models in the future.  

### **Main Features**  
- **Simple Design**:  
  - The model is basic and small, focusing on the essentials of 3D modeling.  
  - Ideal for learning the tools and commands available in AutoCAD for 3D design.  

- **File Format**:  
  - Includes the original AutoCAD drawing file (.dwg), making it easy to view and modify.  

- **Learning Example**:  
  - Perfect for showcasing early design efforts or as an example for other beginners to study and improve their own skills.  

### **Technology**  
Created entirely in AutoCAD, this project uses standard 3D modeling commands and techniques, such as extrude, revolve, and union, to build a foundational model.  

### **Future Enhancements**  
- Building more complex models or adding details to this one.  
- Experimenting with rendering and visualization features in AutoCAD.  
- Converting the model into other formats (e.g., STL) for 3D printing.
